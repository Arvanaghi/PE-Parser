# PE Parser

Written by Brandon Arvanaghi ([@arvanaghi](https://twitter.com/arvanaghi))

## Usage:

Provide PEParser.exe a .exe, .dll, or .sys file, and it will return what kind of executable it is, how large the binary will be in memory, and the name of each section. 

    PEParser.exe <Path\To\Executable>

A specific example:

    PEParser.exe C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe
